# live-reload (In Progress)
Example code for a Node.js based live reload server. The Medium post describing this is here (Link TBD). Note that the techniques used here are just for example purposes to explain WebSockets better. This code will not scale well for production environments.

# Installation
Just run: `npm install`

# Running
Use: `node server.js 8000`
